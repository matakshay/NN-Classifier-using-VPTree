<h1>Nearest Neighbour Classifier using VP Tree</h1>

<p align="justify">
This is an efficient Nearest Neighbour Classifier for classifying images of handwritten digit from the MNIST dataset. It uses a VP Tree to pre-process the images, thus reducing query time complexity. This project was done as part of the Data Structures & Algorithms course at IIT Delhi.

<p align="justify">
    The MNIST dataset <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)</a> has been a landmark dataset in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition. It consists of more than 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten numeric digit, divided into a train set (of 60,000 images) and a test dataset (10,000 images). Each image has a fixed dimension of 28x28 pixels. Each image comes labelled with one of the 10 possible classes (0-9).
    Over the years this dataset has been used for testing many Convolutional Neural Networks and algorithms Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
