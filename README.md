<h1>Nearest Neighbour Classifier using VP Tree</h1>

<p align="justify">
This is an efficient Nearest Neighbour Classifier for classifying images of handwritten digit from the MNIST dataset. It uses a VP Tree to pre-process the images, thus reducing query time complexity. This project was done as part of the Data Structures & Algorithms course at IIT Delhi.
